General:
- Contact issue appeared with X axis, causing jittering of the servo. Fixable temporarily by moving the servo wires connecting to io.
- Messed with the program in run mode to learn how everything works
- Got the conveyor belt working to one direction by shorting the cicruit with KM relay.
- Somewhat figured out what inputs go to PLC and which aren't connected.
Todo:
- Redo X axis servo connections to fix random jittering
- Rewire sensors inputs directly to PLC IO
- Figure out how conveyor belt can be used to both directions
- Rewire conveyor belt to PLC IO
